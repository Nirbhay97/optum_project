# Optum Project

* Following visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from 
  medical researchers and clinicians.
* With the use of machine learning algorithms our application uses parent’s medical history and records, to predict the probability of 
  various diseases in their children, providing the parents with early information for appropriate medical support required.

## Inspiration 
* Infants with genetic disorders, including chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy syndromes or chromosomal deletion or duplication disorders) and
 monogenic  Mendelian disorders (caused by variants in single genes) contribute considerably to mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). 
* In the United States, major congenital malformations, affecting approximately 2% of births, are also reported to be the leading cause of infant   mortality,though the underlying etiology of these malformations may or may not be genetic.
 

 ## What it does ? 
  Our application uses parent’s medical history and records, to predict the probability of various diseases in their children, providing the 
  parents with early   information for appropriate medical support required.
  
  
 ## how we built it ?  
    Our application involves the integration of a webapp along with the machine learning model to create a compete platform ranging 
    from collection of data from    the parents to showing the probability of possible disease in the child.
  
## Challenges Faced  
    Machine learning models require huge amounts of data to be trained and so that they can produce better outputs. 
    The more the data is used for training the algorithm the better the model is expected to perform. Unavailibily of organized data for 
    our project was a major challenge.
  
## what we learnt  
    We learnt about the integration of various machine learning models to along with webapp to produce a completely integrated experiene. 
    It also gave us the  opportunity to get insights on the importance of data analysis and machine learning and sector.
  
## What could be the next move
 * The more the data we have, the better. Collection of more personlized data will allow our model to produce more personlized results. 
 * Inclusion of more    parameters about the parents medical history can be used to give more. optimized results.
